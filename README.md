README

The code in this repository was written using Python 3.10 in an Anaconda environment using the Sublime IDE. 

The files labeled 'castaways_map_code' and 'discs_code' can be used to derive the image map and color key maps for the project. The files labeled 'desert_island_discs_..." contain the spreadsheets with the data used to construct each image. The folder labeled 'Castaways)_original" contains segmented versions of the Castaways map and an Adobe Illustrator file used to create a printable pdf. The file labeled "Castaways_printable" is a PDF that is formatted for large-format printing and can be used as is to recreate a physical form of the map.
